/**
 * An AsyncHandler that returns Response (without body, so status code and
 * headers only) as fast as possible for inspection, but leaves you the option
 * to defer body consumption.
 * <p/>
 * This class introduces new call: getResponse(), that blocks caller thread as
 * long as headers are received, and return Response as soon as possible, but
 * still pouring response body into supplied output stream. This handler is
 * meant for situations when the "recommended" way (using
 * <code>client.prepareGet("http://foo.com/aResource").execute().get()</code>
 * would not work for you, since a potentially large response body is about to
 * be GETted, but you need headers first, or you don't know yet (depending on
 * some logic, maybe coming from headers) where to save the body, or you just
 * want to leave body stream to some other component to consume it.
 * <p/>
 * All these above means that this AsyncHandler needs a bit of different
 * handling than "recommended" way. Some examples:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *     FileOutputStream fos = ...
 *     BodyDeferringAsyncHandler bdah = new BodyDeferringAsyncHandler(fos);
 *     // client executes async
 *     Future&lt;Response&gt; fr = client.prepareGet(&quot;http://foo.com/aresource&quot;).execute(
 * 	bdah);
 *     // main thread will block here until headers are available
 *     Response response = bdah.getResponse();
 *     // you can continue examine headers while actual body download happens
 *     // in separate thread
 *     // ...
 *     // finally &quot;join&quot; the download
 *     fr.get();
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *     PipedOutputStream pout = new PipedOutputStream();
 *     BodyDeferringAsyncHandler bdah = new BodyDeferringAsyncHandler(pout);
 *     // client executes async
 *     Future&lt;Response&gt; fr = client.prepareGet(&quot;http://foo.com/aresource&quot;).execute(bdah);
 *     // main thread will block here until headers are available
 *     Response response = bdah.getResponse();
 *     if (response.getStatusCode() == 200) {
 *      InputStream pin = new BodyDeferringInputStream(fr,new PipedInputStream(pout));
 *      // consume InputStream
 *      ...
 *     } else {
 *      // handle unexpected response status code
 *      ...
 *     }
 * </pre>
