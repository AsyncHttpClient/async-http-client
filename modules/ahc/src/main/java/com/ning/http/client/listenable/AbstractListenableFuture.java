 * guarantee that all registered listeners will be executed. Listener/Executor
 * pairs are stored in the execution list and executed in the order in which
 * they were added, but because of thread scheduling issues there is no
 * guarantee that the JVM will execute them in order. In addition, listeners
 * added after the task is complete will be executed immediately, even if some
 * previously added listeners have not yet been executed.
